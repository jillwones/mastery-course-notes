# Specification:

# I'm a client working for the Blank House. We want to display positive 
# tweets about our president on our website. However, our president is kind of 
# unpopular, and we pretty much only receive negative press. Write me a program 
# that filters out the following words from tweets: "sucks", "bad", "hate", "foolish", 
# and the most popular: "danger to society". Replace each negative word or phrase them 
# with the word "CENSORED". Some test tweets have been provided for you.
