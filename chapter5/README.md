# Chapter 5 - Other Objects

The message `gets` calls a method on the main object. This method returns a string. This string usually has a \n newline character in it. To get the string without the newline, use the string `chomp` method. A line of code using gets usually looks something like this: `user_input = gets.chomp`. The program will wait for the user to input a string, then continue with whatever procedure it's doing.

Lots about Classes and Objects.    
`"Hello"' is an instance of the String class.    
The class String is an instance of Class class.
The process of asking classes to create instances is called **instantiation**
* Class objects produce Instance objects.
* Instance objects do all sorts of things.  

The main object is a special kind of instance of the Object class. All instances of all classes are, ultimately, instances of the Object class.    
Every object has its own, unique, internal object id or 'memory address'. It is displayed as a hexadecimal 0x007fadf88045f0
