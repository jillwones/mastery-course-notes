# Chapter 1 - Hello World

irb (Interactive Ruby Shell) is a REPL (‘Read–Evaluate–Print Loop’) -  a REPL is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user

---

When we run a REPL program, we:

1. set up the Ruby world, and
2. we get the ability to write Ruby code to modify that world on-the-fly.

When launching the irb, if you want to load a file directly to the irb you can require the file using `irb -r ./hello_world.rb`.       
Or if you launch the irb then want to load the file you type `require './hello_world.rb'`.        
Or you can run the file directly in the terminal using `ruby ./hello_world.rb`
