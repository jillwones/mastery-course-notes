# Chapter 6 - Advanced Flow of Control

Got to get better at breaking down a specification into really clear and concise step-by-step requirements (**algorithmic thinking**), for example:    

"I don't like my friend Sam, so much so that my hatred spills over to anyone with a first name beginning with 'S'. I want a program that, when anyone types their name in, shouts at them if their name begins with an 'S'. Anyone else should just get a friendly greeting." 

To:
* The user sees a greeting, which asks them to enter their name.
* The user enters their name.
* If the user's name begins with 'S', the program shouts the user's name back at them.
* If the user's name begins with any other letter, the program just says 'Hi, ' plus their name.
